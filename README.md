### Instalation üîß

_Clone this repo_

_Install dependencies using `npm`_

```
npm install
```

## Database & Server Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

For serving the HTTP API i have used [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server#add-custom-routes), this allows to get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds, install it using this command:

```
npm install -g json-server
```

Then after install the package run the following command (Please replace ${REPO_PATH} properly based on your host):

```
json-server --watch ${REPO_PATH}/fligths/src/db/db.json
```

After server started check the output and set properly the enviroment vars in `.env` file (file .env.example is included in this repo)
```
VUE_APP_API_URL='http://localhost'
VUE_APP_API_PORT='3000'
```

## Getting Starting ‚öôÔ∏è

Execute next command to start the app, then go to the url shown in the terminal console, usually `http://localhost:8080/`
```
npm run dev
```


## Workflow

Once the App is running on your server you must see the next screen, with some stats about database records
